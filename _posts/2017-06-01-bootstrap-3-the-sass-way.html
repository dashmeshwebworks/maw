<p class="lead">In this article, I'm going to go over Bootstrap and how to use it with SASS. I'll discuss the advantages that it can bring as a developer and some of the disadvantages that come along with that.</p>

<p>I've been using Bootstrap for about 4 years now. You could say that I'm pretty good at using it; well at least I thought I was good at it. When I started using Bootstrap I learnt how to use all of the componentry that comes with it. You can learn how to use all the components that the framework has to offer on the website: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" title="Bootstrap documentation">http://getbootstrap.com/</a>. I learnt how to quickly develop websites with cool features like wells, thumbnails, carousels and much more. However, this didn't mean that I knew how to write the CSS that creates these components.  </p>

<p>It all started to make sense once I had installed Bootstrap the SASS way. You need to know a couple of things to get it up and running. My workflow includes using Grunt to compile my SCSS via the command line. You can learn how to use Grunt via the command line quite easily: <a href="https://gruntjs.com/getting-started" target="_blank" title="Get started with Grunt">https://gruntjs.com/getting-started</a>. You can then install <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass" target="_blank" title="Bootstrap sass github ">bootstrap-sass</a> using a package manager such as <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/" target="_blank" title="Yarn Package Manager">yarn</a> or <a href="https://bower.io/" target="_blank" title="Bower Package Manager">bower</a>. Then all you have to do is compile a bootstrap.scss file using grunt and then reference your final CSS file in the head of your website.</p>

<p>In reference to the codepen above, I have an example of the _bootstrap.scss file. You'll want to duplicate the _bootstrap.scss file and create your own version. Just so that you don't edit any of the core bootstrap files that you install using your package manager. This is the file that will be compiled by Grunt to create the final bootstrap.min.css file that you link to in the head of your website. As you can see each Bootstrap component is separated into its own SCSS file. This is how you can really learn what and how Bootstrap works. You can go into each SCSS file and see how that component was made. This has helped me understand and learn more about SCSS and CSS in general. You can start to learn how to use certain mixins and functions that Bootstrap has built in to help create new things. I'm sure I'll write an article in the future about a few of those mixins and functions. For now, I'll just introduce you to using Bootstrap with SASS in its purest form.</p>

<p>The main thing to keep in mind with this is to never edit any of the core Bootstrap files that are downloaded via the package manager. If you want to make edits create a duplicate copy of that file and reference it in your custom _bootstrap.scss file. This helps especially with when you want to update Bootstrap using your chosen package manager.</p>

<p>One of the great advantages of having the variables file is that you can comment out any components that you're not using. This allows for your final compiled version of Bootstrap to be a smaller size. It goes hand in hand with how Google inspect element tools ask to only load CSS that is being used on the page the user is viewing. It also helps optimise your CSS delivery by having a smaller footprint. The only disadvantage here is you have to remember if you exclude a line in your _bootstrap.scss file. For example, if you include a well from the Bootstrap documentation and it isn't styled properly it’s because you haven't included it within your _bootstrap.scss file.</p>

<p>Another tip to take note of is how I have a bootstrap-variables file at the top of the codepen example. This is a copy of the file, line 5. The file should start off completely commented out. The Bootstrap variables file is a huge settings page that allows you to change general style elements in your Bootstrap theme. If you want to change certain parts of your Bootstrap theme you uncomment that line and make a change. This way you are not changing any of Bootstraps core files. For example, if you wanted to change the primary theme colour you could uncomment the $brand-primary variable and change the value to a colour you want to use. </p>

<p>So I say get on the bandwagon and enjoy the party because Bootstrap with SASS is here to stay. Not to mention that in <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank" title="Bootstrap 4 documentation">Bootstrap 4</a> they have switched from LESS to SASS for their source CSS files. So it'll be a good idea to start using it now in Bootstrap 3 and getting to grips with SASS in general.
