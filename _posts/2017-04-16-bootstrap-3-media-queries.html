<p class="lead">I'm always having to refer to my favourite little cheat sheet when writing out media queries. I guess you can say that my brain got a little lazy. It's hard trying to remember the line of code that allows us to set specific CSS styles to certain viewports, or I'm simply making my life a little easier.</p>

<p>I've been using Bootstrap to build websites for quite some time now. So this code snippet is relative to the Bootstrap 3 implementation of the framework. You can read the documentation for building websites with Bootstrap on their <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">website</a>. The documentation itself does go over the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-media-queries" target="_blank">media queries</a> in pretty much the same detail. I find it easier to refer to my own documentation on Github and I update it to make sure it aligns with Bootstrap most up to date implementation.
